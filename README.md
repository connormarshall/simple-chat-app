# How to Run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#Testing with other users

Using port forwarding, you can test this app with other users without hosting it.
Run the following commands:

### `npm install ngrok`

Then, while the react app is running with the command:

### `npm start`

You can expose port 3000 like so:

### `ngrok http 3000`

Copy the URL generated by ngrok into your browser and send it to friends. You can
monitor server request traffic in the terminal window.
